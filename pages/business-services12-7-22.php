																			<p>Brink's partnership with Atlanta Retailers Association (ARA) and PFCU allows you to take advantage of special rates for integrated cash management solutions. As a full-service security organization Brink has developed solid and proven specialized transportation and cash management services that are structured to deliver innovative solutions to fit your special needs.</p>
																			<p>Brink's cash management services are driven by the Brink Cash Manager SafeSM program whereby an electronic smart safe is installed within your store to validate and secure your cash directly at the point-of-sale and remain secure until Brink arrives to pickup your deposits. Cash Manager SafeSM users save several hours a day by not having to count cash and prepare daily deposits as the safe prepares your deposit automatically transaction by transaction and is ready when Brink arrives to service your location.</p>
																			<p>What's more, Brink through PFCU can facilitate Advanced CreditSM, giving provisional credit in your PFCU Business Checking Account for cash that remains secured in the safe within your store locations.</p>
																			<p>To learn more about our partnership with Brink contact Brink representative. Allen Coleman – Regional Sales Executive. O: 770-409-8974; C: 404-886-5647 <a href="mailto:Allen.Coleman@Brinks.com">Allen.Coleman@Brinks.com</a></p>

																			<p align="center"><strong>FUNDS AVAILABILITY POLICY DISCLOSURE</strong></p>
																			<p align="center"><strong>YOUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW FUNDS</strong></p>
																			<p>Platinum Federal Credit Union's policy is to make funds from your check deposits available to you on the first business day after the day we receive your deposit. Cash and Electronic direct deposits will be available on the day we receive the deposit. Once they are available, you can withdraw the funds in cash and we will use the funds to pay checks that you have written.</p>
																			<p>For determining the availability of your deposit, every day is a business day, except Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays. If you make a deposit before the end of business day, on a business day that we are open, we will consider that day to be the day of your deposit. However, if you make a deposit after end of business day or on a day we are not open, we will consider that the deposit was made on the next business day we are open.</p>

																			<p align="center"><strong>LONGER DELAYS MAY APPLY</strong></p>
																			<p>In some cases, we will not make all of the funds that you deposit by check available to you on the first business day after the day of your deposit. Depending on the type of check that you deposit, funds may not be available until the second business day after the day of your deposit. The first $200 of your deposits, however, will be available on the first business day.</p>
																			<p>If we are not going to make all of the funds from your deposit available on the first business day, we will notify you at the time you make your deposit. We will also tell you when the funds will be available. If your deposit is not made directly to one of our employees, or if we decide to take this action after you have left the premises, we will mail you the notice by the day after we receive your deposit.</p>
																			<p>If you will need the funds from a deposit right away, you should ask us when the funds will be available.</p>
																			<p>In addition, funds you deposit by check may be delayed for a longer period under the following circumstances:</p>
																			<ul class="listing-mark iq-tw-6 iq-font-black iq-pb-15">
																				<li>We believe a check you deposit will not be paid.</li>
																				<li>You deposit checks totaling more than $5,000 on any one day.</li>
																				<li>You deposit checks not made payable to you.</li>
																				<li>You redeposit a check that has been returned unpaid.</li>
																				<li>You have overdrawn your account repeatedly in the last six months.</li>
																				<li>There is an emergency, such as failure of computer or communications equipment.</li>
																			</ul>

																			<p>We will notify you if we delay your ability to withdraw funds for any of these reasons, and we will tell you when the funds will be available. They will generally be available no later than the seventh business day after the day of your deposit.</p>

																			<p align="center"><strong>SPECIAL RULES FOR NEW ACCOUNTS</strong></p>
																			<p>If you are a new member, the following special rules will apply during the first 30 days your account is open.</p>
																			<p>Funds from electronic direct deposits to your account will be available on the day we receive the deposit. Funds from deposits of cash, wire transfers, and the first $5,000 of a day's total deposits of cashier's, certified, teller's, traveler's and federal, state, and local government checks will be available on the first business day after the day of your deposit if the deposit meets certain conditions. For example, the checks must be payable to you. The excess over $5,000 will be available on the seventh business day after the day of your deposit. If your deposit of these checks (other than a U. S. Treasury check) is not made in person to one of our employees, the first $5,000 will not be available until the second business day after the day of your deposit.</p>
																			<p>Funds from all other check deposits will be available on the seventh business day after the day of your deposit.</p>

																				5. Your chances of paying a merchant’s expensive returned-check charge are limited.<br>

																			<p align="center"><strong>Platinum Federal Credit Union Discretionary Overdraft Privilege Policy</strong></p>
																			<p>It is the policy of Platinum Federal Credit Union to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and to conduct business in accordance with applicable safety and soundness standards. The Membership Account Agreement and Disclosure provided to you at the time you opened your account with us controls the duties, obligations and rights of the Depositor, the Authorized Signatories and Platinum Federal Credit Union with regard to your checking account. The Membership Account Agreement (and all amendments thereto) and its terms shall control any possible conflict, if any, between any provision of this Discretionary Overdraft Privilege Policy and the Membership Account Agreement and Disclosure. A copy of the Membership Account Agreement and Disclosure is available to you on request from a Platinum Federal Credit Union representative.</p>
																			<p>Overdraft privilege is not a line of credit. However, if you inadvertently overdraw your account, we will have the discretion to pay the overdraft, subject to the limit of your overdraft privilege and the amount of the overdraft fee. Platinum Federal Credit Union is not obligated to pay any item presented for payment if your account does not contain sufficient available funds. Any discretionary payment by Platinum Federal Credit Union of an overdraft check (or items, such as a ACH Debit) does not obligate Platinum Federal Credit Union to pay any other overdraft check (or item), or to provide prior notice of its decision to refuse to pay such check (or item).</p>
																			<p>Pursuant to Platinum Federal Credit Union’s commitment to always provide you with the best level of service, now and in the future, if your checking account has been open for at least thirty (30) days and thereafter you maintain your account in good standing, which includes at least:</p>
																			<p>A) Bringing your account to a positive balance within every thirty (30) day period for a minimum period of 24 hours;<br>
																				B) Not being in default on any loan or other obligation to Platinum Federal Credit Union; and<br>
																				C) Not being subject to any legal or administrative order or levy, Platinum Federal Credit Union will have the discretion to pay overdrafts within the overdraft privilege limits. Payment by Platinum Federal Credit Union is a discretionary courtesy and not a right of the accountholder or an obligation of Platinum Federal Credit Union. Business members will be required to fill out an application to request overdraft privilege and submit tax returns and other documents which will help PFCU credit committee to approve a defined overdraft privilege limit. This privilege for personal checking accounts will generally be limited to a maximum of $500 (up to $10,000 for retail businesses and up to $50,000 for wholesale businesses) overdraft (negative) balance. Of course, any and all fees and charges, including without limitation the non-sufficient funds fees (as set forth in our fee schedules and membership account agreement and disclosure), will be included as part of this maximum amount. It may be possible that your account will become overdrawn in excess of the overdraft privilege amount as a result of the assessment of a fee.</p>
																			<p>The total of the discretionary Overdraft Privilege (negative) balance, which includes any and all fees and charges, including all non-sufficient funds/overdraft fees is due and payable upon demand, and Depositor and each Authorized Signatory will continue to be liable, jointly and severally, for all such amounts, as described in the Membership Account Agreement and Disclosure.</p>
																			<p>Our standard OD Privilege Fee of $25.00 will be imposed for overdrafts created by checks, ACH, ATM withdrawals, everyday debit card transactions, in-person withdrawals, or by other electronic means. If your account balance remains overdrawn for longer than 3 days, we will charge your account a collection fee of $15.00.</p>
																			<p>Transactions may not be processed in the order in which they occurred, and the order in which transactions are received and processed may impact the total amount of fees incurred. While Platinum Federal Credit Union will have the discretion to pay overdrafts on accounts in good standing (as described above), any such payment is a discretionary courtesy, and not a right of the accountholder or an obligation of Platinum Federal Credit Union and Platinum Federal Credit Union in its sole and absolute discretion, can cease paying overdrafts at any time without prior notice of reason or cause.</p>
																			<p>Platinum Federal Credit Union will not pay overdrafts for ATM or everyday debit card transactions after August 15, 2010 unless Platinum Federal Credit Union has provided you with the notice required by section 205.17(b) of Regulation E and you have opted in to the payment of these overdrafts. In order to avoid overdrafts due to ATM and everyday debit card transactions, Platinum Federal Credit Union will place a hold on your account for any ATM or everyday debit card transaction authorized until the transaction settles. ATM and everyday debit card transactions usually settle within three business days after the transaction is authorized. The amount of the hold will be for the amount authorized, or as permitted under applicable payment network rules. Holds on authorized ATM and everyday debit card transactions will be removed prior to settlement where required by applicable payment network rules. In addition you may opt out of the Overdraft Privilege services for check, ACH and debit card bill payment transactions at any time by contacting one of our Member Service Representatives.</p>
