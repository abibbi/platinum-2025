For 2019, PFCU is on track to achieve our goals. Membership, De- posit, Loan, Account and Net Worth growth all are moving in the right direction.

Use these prevention tips to protect your information.<br/>1. Do not share personal information. Whether over the phone, via mail, or online, don’t share your financial account information or Social Security number unless you know the person requesting the information is who he or she claims to be.<br/>2. Control access to your financial information. Store it in a safe place and shred old credit card and ATM receipts, old account statements, and unused credit card offers.<br/>3. Protect your PINs and passwords. Avoid using information such as your mother’s maiden name, your birth date, the last four digits of your Social, or your phone num- ber, as identity thieves can use this information to access your accounts.<br/>4. Carry only the minimum amount of identification and credit cards necessary.<br/>5. Review statements. Carefully review your statements to ensure you authorized all<br/>charges shown.<br/>6. Guard your mailbox from theft. Pay your bills online with Bill Pay instead of through<br/>the mail and opt to receive eStatements.<br/>7. Monitor your credit report. Consumers are entitled to one free credit report from<br/>each credit reporting agency annually.<br/>8. Opt-out of pre-approved credit cards, direct mail lists and telephone solicitation.<br/>For more information on identity theft, visit the NCUA’s Fraud Prevention Center at www. mycreditunion.gov.<br/>PFCU ELECTION WATCH<br/>Platinum Federal Credit Union is soliciting members to be elected to the PFCU Board of Directors for 2020 – 2023.
