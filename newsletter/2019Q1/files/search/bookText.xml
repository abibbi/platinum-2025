On behalf of the Board of Directors, Committees, Management and Staff of Platinum Federal Credit Union (PFCU), I would like to wish every member “Navroz Mubarak!”
PFCU’s 19th Annual Meeting & Scholarship Awards will be held on Sunday, April 28th at 11:30 am at the
Ashiana Banquet Hall. Last year we set a record in Scholar- ship Awards by awarding 42 scholarships of $2,500 each to- taling to $105,000. We hope to maintain the $100,000 Schol- arship for this year and years to come. If any member would like to contribute to the PFCU Scholarship Program, please email info@platinumfcu.org or call us at 404.297.9797. We encourage members to attend the Annual Meeting to learn about the 2019 plan and progress made in 2018 as well as encourage and appreciate the hard work of our youth who will be receiving scholarships.
As we have started executing the Strategic Plan for 2019, we are working to make changes to our website, online and in-branch loan and membership applications, phone sys- tem, etc. This will allow us to further simplify the process of becoming members of PFCU as well as applying for loans, tracking applications, etc.
If you have a Platinum Secure Checking account and have not already enrolled in the securechecking.com website, please do so to take benefit of all the services offered by your Plat- inum Secure Checking Account such as Credit Monitoring, Free Credit Report, Identity Theft Monitoring, Alerts, AD&D Insurance, Cell Phone Insurance, discounted movie tickets for AMC/Regal, thousands of coupons for national and regional retailers, and much more.... If you don’t already have a Plati- num Secure Checking account, make sure you open one to- day to reap the benefits offered by having this account.
There have been additional requirements requested by Fin- CEN that financial institutions need to obtain from mem- bers who own ATMs. Our Compliance staff may have already reached out to you, please help us to continue to service you and be in compliance with all the rules and regulations appli- cable for us to continue to provide this service.
With your participation and our staff and volunteers’ hard work, we can keep serving our members and continue to im- prove the level of service. This will help us help more mem- bers of our community and achieve more milestones.
Sincerely,
Rahim Asani

 Teach financial responsibility - A savings account gives kids some control over their money and encourages them to save rather than spend.
 Make saving a habit - Teaching kids the 10% rule early, will help them save and put money back even when they have bills to pay.
 Teach debt management - Debt interest costs the average U.S. household more than $6,000 a year. A savings account can teach kids to save for items they need and will hopefully keep them out of debt when they’re older.
 Start a conversation - Talk to your kids about the importance of saving and how you’re saving money for retirement, their college, etc.
Youth Savings Month is the perfect time to start teaching the importance of savings. Open your child’s first savings account at the credit union this month and put them on a path to owning their future!
Do you have enough saved for retirement?
According to GoBankingRates, 42% of Americans have less than $10,000 saved for retire- ment and 14% have nothing saved. Although it can seem daunting to save enough to last through your retirement years, it isn’t impossible. In fact, the hardest thing about saving for retirement is just getting started. Consider these tips:
1. Start saving now - Look at your budget for areas where you can cut spending and then aim to save at least 10% of your income for retirement.
2. Participate in your 401(k) - Participate in your employer’s 401(k) and take full advantage of any matching contribution. The money you save is automatically deposited into the plan before it’s taxed.
3. Get an IRA - If you aren’t eligible for a retirement fund at work, sign up for a Traditional or Roth IRA... or both! Contributions to a traditional are tax-deductible, meaning every dollar you contribute reduces your taxable income. Roth IRAs, on the other hand, are funded with after-tax dollars. You can’t deduct contributions, but you don’t pay taxes when you withdraw.
A retirement plan can help you ensure that you have enough retirement savings to live the life you want to live. Put yourself on the path to retirement success by saving now. For additional expertise on how to get started, contact us!
