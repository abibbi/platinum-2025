Or you can email to memberservice@platinumfcu.org to request a copy by mail.The beginning of 2017 saw the update and launch to a new mobile app 3.0. Itnot only updated the look and feel of the app, but also added several features such as mobile deposit capture, touch ID and PIN login, etc. Also in keeping with our philosophy of ongoing Technology implementation, the mobile App has been updated again to provide support for Apple iPhone X face recognition login, check images, and you can sign out and back in with touch ID or PIN in Android and IOS.PFCU also launched its new Online Banking to provide members with the omni channel online and mobile banking experience. We will be adding some more features to both online and mobile banking platform, so stay tuned.We also had another very well attended and invaluable Strategic Planning Meeting weekend with Members of the Board of Directors, Various Committees and Senior Staff, looking back at the year and planning forward including setting the budgets for the next 5 years.In 2017, one of the product changes saw Personal, Signature and Business loans limits increased from $50,000 to $100,000. In March/April time in 2018, keep an eye out for the launch of Platinum Secure Checking product, that will provide members with ID Theft Protection, Credit Monitoring, Cell Phone Insurance, Various Discounts, AD&D Insurance and Enhanced Warranty on Debit Card Purchases.Also, something we are very excited about are the extensive online Financial Education Modules coming soon on the PFCU site, from money basics to calculators and planning for personal and business, from savings to retirement.I would ask the members to watch out for the date and location for the Annual General Meeting, so you can mark your diaries and attend.Sincerely, Kas Jinnah Chairman]]></page><page Index="2" isMAC="true"><![CDATA[ConsolidateConsolidateCredit CardCredit CardDebt and Save!Debt and Save!Consolidate your credit card debt with the Platinum FCU VISA® Credit Card and enjoy big savings for the  rst 9 months!From now until February 28, 2018 transfer your outstandingbalance and choose from two ways to save:0% balance transfer fee with a low 2.99% APR* for nine months2% balance transfer fee with 0% APR for nine months*Annual Percentage Rate | Subject to credit approval.
