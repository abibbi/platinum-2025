Check all doors and windows before you leave to ensure they’re locked up tight. Also reinforce sliding doors at the base of the doors (or windows) with a broom, yardstick, or other block.<br/>2. Ask a friend or neighbor to help out. They can pick up your mail or packages until your return from your trip.<br/>3. Make it look like someone is at home. Set timers to turn your lights on and off and leave a car parked in your driveway if possible.<br/>4. Don’t tell criminals you’re leaving by broadcasting your absence on social media. You can still post those great photos as soon as you return. You don’t want to spend your vacay on your phone anyway!<br/>5. Install cameras for real peace of mind. Smart home products can make your life much safer and your vacation much sweeter!<br/>    1-877-PFCU4YOU (732-8496) www.platinumfcu.org Info@platinumfcu.org<br/>Board of Directors<br/>Rahim Asani Chairman<br/>Amin Premjee Vice Chairman<br/>Ali Jamal Secretary<br/>Fazal Manji Treasurer<br/>Karim Kaisani Director-Supervisory Committee<br/>Shahina Punjani Director-Marketing<br/>Shereza Tajuddin Director-Recovery<br/>Moyees Merchant Director-Outreach<br/>Mansoor Wadasariya Director<br/>Holiday Closings<br/>Independence Day<br/>Thursday, July 4, 2019<br/>Imamat Day<br/>Closing Early, Thursday, July 11, 2019<br/>Labor Day<br/>Monday, September 2, 2019<br/>             We have more than 5,000 shared branch locations.
